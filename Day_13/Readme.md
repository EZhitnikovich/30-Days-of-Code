# Task
Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

* Inherits from Book
* Has a parameterized constructor taking these  parameters:
	1. string *title*
	1. string *author*
	1. int *price*
* Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these *3* lines:
	1. *Title:*, a space, and then the current instance's *title*.
	1. *Author:*, a space, and then the current instance's *author*.
	1. *Price:*, a space, and then the current instance's *price*.
